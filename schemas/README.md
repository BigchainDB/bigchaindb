# Introduction

This directory contains the schemas for the different JSON documents BigchainDB uses.

The aim is to provide:
 - a strict definition/documentation of the data structures used in BigchainDB
 - a language independent tool to validate the structure of incoming/outcoming
   data (there are several ready to use
   [implementations](http://json-schema.org/implementations.html) written in
   different languages)

## Learn about JSON Schema
A good resource is [Understanding JSON Schema](http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/index.html).
It provides a *more accessible documentation for JSON schema*.
