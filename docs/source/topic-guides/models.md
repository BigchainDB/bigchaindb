# The Transaction, Block and Vote Models

This page was getting too big, so it was split into manageable pieces. It will be deleted eventually, so update your links. Here are links to the pieces:

* Documentation about transactions, the transaction model, the asset model, (crypto-)conditions, and fulfillments was moved to [the root BigchainDB docs](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/index.html).

* [The Block Model](../block-model.html)

* [The Vote Model](../vote-model.html)
