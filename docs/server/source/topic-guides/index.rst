Topic Guides
============

.. note::

   Most of the Topic Guides were moved over to `the root BigchainDB project docs <https://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/index.html>`_.

   The page about transactions, blocks and votes models was split apart into new pages:

   - :doc:`Transaction Concepts <../transaction-concepts>`
   - :doc:`The Transaction Model <../transaction-model/index>`
   - :doc:`The Block Model <../block-model>`
   - :doc:`The Vote Model <../vote-model>`
