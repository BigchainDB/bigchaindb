    This is the outer transaction wrapper. It contains the ID, version and the body of the transaction, which is also called `transaction`.
properties:
  id:

    type: string
    description: |
        A sha3 digest of the transaction. The ID is calculated by removing all
        derived hashes and signatures from the transaction, serializing it to
        JSON with keys in sorted order and then hashing the resulting string
        with sha3.

        Type of the transaction:

        A `CREATE` transaction creates an asset in BigchainDB. This
        transaction has outputs (conditions) but no inputs (fulfillments),
        so a dummy fulfillment is used.

        A `TRANSFER` transaction transfers ownership of an asset, by providing
        fulfillments to conditions of earlier transactions.

        A `GENESIS` transaction is a special case transaction used as the
        sole member of the first block in a BigchainDB ledger.

    - CREATE
    - TRANSFER
