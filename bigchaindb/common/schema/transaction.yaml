    type: string
    description: |
        A sha3 digest of the transaction. The ID is calculated by removing all
        derived hashes and signatures from the transaction, serializing it to
        JSON with keys in sorted order and then hashing the resulting string
        with sha3.

        Type of the transaction:

        A `CREATE` transaction creates an asset in BigchainDB. This
        transaction has outputs (conditions) but no inputs (fulfillments),
        so a dummy fulfillment is used.

        A `TRANSFER` transaction transfers ownership of an asset, by providing
        fulfillments to conditions of earlier transactions.

        A `GENESIS` transaction is a special case transaction used as the
        sole member of the first block in a BigchainDB ledger.
    enum:
    - CREATE
    - TRANSFER
    - GENESIS
  asset:
    type: object
    description: |
        Description of the asset being transacted. In the case of a `TRANSFER`
        transaction, this field contains only the ID of asset. In the case
        of a `CREATE` transaction, this field may contain properties:

      refillable:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Whether the amount of the asset can change after its creation. Defaults to false.
