# How to Contribute to the BigchainDB Project

There are many ways you can contribute to the BigchainDB project, some very easy and others more involved. We want to be friendly and welcoming to all potential contributors, so we ask that everyone involved abide by some simple guidelines outlined in our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Easy Ways to Contribute

If you want to file a bug report or suggest a feature, please go to the `bigchaindb/bigchaindb` repository on GitHub and [create a new Issue](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/new). (You will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) (free).) Please describe the issue clearly, including steps to reproduce it, if it's a bug.

## How to Contribute Code or Documentation

### Step 0 - Decide on an Issue to Resolve, or Create One

We want you to feel like your contributions (pull requests) are welcome, but if you contribute something unnecessary, unwanted, or perplexing, then your experience may be unpleasant. Your pull request may sit gathering dust as everyone scratches their heads wondering what to do with it.

To prevent that situation, we ask that all pull requests should resolve, address, or fix an existing issue. If there is no existing issue, then you should create one first. That way there can be commentary and discussion first, and you can have a better idea of what to expect when you create a corresponding pull request.

When you submit a pull request, please mention the issue (or issues) that it resolves, e.g. "Resolves #123".

Exception: hotfixes and minor changes don't require a pre-existing issue, but please write a thorough pull request description.

### Step 1 - Prepare and Familiarize Yourself

To contribute code or documentation, you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).

Familiarize yourself with how we do coding and documentation in the BigchainDB project, including:

* [our Python Style Guide](PYTHON_STYLE_GUIDE.md)
* [how we write and run tests](./tests/README.md)
* [our documentation strategy](./docs/README.md) (including in-code documentation)
* the GitHub Flow (workflow)
  * [GitHub Guide: Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
  * [Scott Chacon's blog post about GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)
* [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)

### Step 2 - Install some Dependencies

We recommend using `Docker` and `Docker Compose` based workflow for testing and development of bigchaindb. So the only dependencies you need to install are [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Step 3 - Fork the bigchaindb/bigchaindb GitHub Repository

In your web browser, go to [the bigchaindb/bigchaindb repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb) and click the `Fork` button in the top right corner. This creates a new Git repository named `bigchaindb` in _your_ GitHub account.

### Step 4 - Clone Your Fork

(This only has to be done once.) In your local terminal, use Git to clone _your_ `bigchaindb` repository to your local computer. Also add the original GitHub bigchaindb/bigchaindb repository as a remote named `upstream` (a convention):

```text
git clone git@github.com:your-github-username/bigchaindb.git
cd bigchaindb
git remote add upstream git@github.com:bigchaindb/bigchaindb.git
```

### Step 5 - Fetch and Merge the Latest from `upstream/master`

Switch to the `master` branch locally, fetch all `upstream` branches, and merge the just-fetched `upstream/master` branch with the local `master` branch:

```text
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

### Step 6 - Build and Run

To use and run the source code you just cloned from your fork for local development and testing. Run the following command to build a docker image from your cloned fork

```text
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

NOTE: If you already ran the above command once you can just run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build bdb` to speed up the build process for any subsequent builds

Now you can run the `bdb` service (i.e. BigchainDB Server) you built above with the following command:

```text
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up bdb
```

The above command will start three containerized services i.e. mongodb, tendermint and bigchaindb. It will also detach to `bdb` service logs on your terminal. Now you will be able to access your bigchaindb server at `localhost:9984`

Now you can detach the bigchaindb container with `Ctrl+C` and use the above two commands to re-build and run bigchaindb server again with latest code changes in your forked repo.

NOTE: Once done with development you can stop and remove all running docker containers with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml rm -f -s`

### Step 7 - Create a New Branch for Each Bug/Feature

If your new branch is to **fix a bug** identified in a specific GitHub Issue with number `ISSNO`, then name your new branch `bug/ISSNO/short-description-here`. For example, `bug/67/fix-leap-year-crash`.

If your new branch is to **add a feature** requested in a specific GitHub Issue with number `ISSNO`, then name your new branch `feat/ISSNO/short-description-here`. For example, `feat/135/blue-background-on-mondays`.

Otherwise, please give your new branch a short, descriptive, all-lowercase name.

```text
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

### Step 8 - Make Edits, git add, git commit

With your new branch checked out locally, make changes or additions to the code or documentation. Remember to:

* follow [our Python Style Guide](PYTHON_STYLE_GUIDE.md).
* write and run tests for any new or changed code. There's [a README file in the `tests/` folder](./tests/README.md) about how to do that.
* add or update documentation as necessary. Follow [our documentation strategy](./docs/README.md).

As you go, git add and git commit your changes or additions, e.g.

```text
git add new-or-changed-file-1
git add new-or-changed-file-2
git commit -m "Short description of new or changed things"
```

We use [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) which should be triggered with every commit. Some hooks will change files but others will give errors that need to be fixed. Every time a hook is failing you need to add the changed files again.
The hooks we use can be found in the [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

You will want to merge changes from upstream (i.e. the original repository) into your new branch from time to time, using something like:

```text
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

Once you're done commiting a set of new things and you're ready to submit them for inclusion, please be sure to run all the tests as per the instructions in [the README file in the `tests/` folder](./tests/README.md).

(When you submit your pull request [following the instructions below], we run all the tests automatically, so we will see if some are failing. If you don't know why some tests are failing, you can still submit your pull request, but be sure to note the failing tests and to ask for help with resolving them.)

### Step 9 - Push Your New Branch to origin

Make sure you've commited all the additions or changes you want to include in your pull request. Then push your new branch to origin (i.e. _your_ remote bigchaindb repository).

```text
git push origin new-branch-name
```

### Step 10 - Create a Pull Request

Go to the GitHub website and to _your_ remote bigchaindb repository (i.e. something like https://github.com/your-user-name/bigchaindb). 

See [GitHub's documentation on how to initiate and send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Note that the destination repository should be `bigchaindb/bigchaindb` and the destination branch will be `master` (usually, and if it's not, then we can change that if necessary).

If this is the first time you've submitted a pull request to BigchainDB, then you must read and accept the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before we can merge your contributions. That can be found at [https://www.bigchaindb.com/cla](https://www.bigchaindb.com/cla).

Once you accept and submit the CLA, we'll email you with further instructions. (We will send you a long random string to put in the comments section of your pull request, along with the text, "I have read and agree to the terms of the BigchainDB Contributor License Agreement.")

Someone will then merge your branch or suggest changes. If we suggest changes, you won't have to open a new pull request, you can just push new code to the same branch (on `origin`) as you did before creating the pull request.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
1. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, and pass the flake8 check.
1. Follow the pull request template when creating new PRs. The template will
   be inserted when you create a new pull request.
